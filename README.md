# üõ†Ô∏è System Maintenance

1. Update distribution.
2. Update system and services.
3. Remove unnecessary libraries.
4. Set automatic updates on every boot.

### Unattended-upgrades 

Unattended-upgrades is a package available on Linux systems that automates the process of installing security updates. It is commonly used to keep the operating system and installed software up-to-date with the latest security patches.

```sh
# Install unattended-upgrades for automatic updates
sudo apt-get install unattended-upgrades

# Create the following file to configure the update settings
echo 'APT::Periodic::Update-Package-Lists "1";' | sudo tee /etc/apt/apt.conf.d/20auto-upgrades
echo 'APT::Periodic::Unattended-Upgrade "1";' | sudo tee -a /etc/apt/apt.conf.d/20auto-upgrades

# Enable automatic updates
sudo dpkg-reconfigure --priority=low unattended-upgrades

# Update distribution (might cause problem with used apt process)
sudo apt dist-upgrade

# Update system and services
sudo apt update && sudo apt upgrade

# Removal of unnecessary libraries
sudo apt-get autoremove && sudo apt-get autoremove --purge
```


# üë®‚Äçüíº Accounts
1. Password policies
- Password age
- Password complexity requirements
- Implement multi-factor authentication where possible.
2. Account restrictions for regular user
- Disable execution, let write and read contents.
- Disable system paths.
- Establish the least privilege.

Paths/Directories required for workstation user to work properly: 


### Main syntax
```sh
# Set the minimum password length to 12 characters
echo "password requisite pam_pwquality.so minlen=12" | sudo tee -a /etc/pam.d/sshd
# Require at least one uppercase letter in passwords
echo "password requisite pam_pwquality.so ucredit=-1" | sudo tee -a /etc/pam.d/sshd
# Require at least one lowercase letter in passwords
echo "password requisite pam_pwquality.so lcredit=-1" | sudo tee -a /etc/pam.d/sshd
# Require at least one digit in passwords
echo "password requisite pam_pwquality.so dcredit=-1" | sudo tee -a /etc/pam.d/sshd
# Require at least one special character in passwords
echo "password requisite pam_pwquality.so ocredit=-1" | sudo tee -a /etc/pam.d/sshd
# Enforce password history, preventing reuse of the last 5 passwords
echo "password requisite pam_pwhistory.so remember=5" | sudo tee -a /etc/pam.d/sshd
# Lock accounts after a defined number of unsuccessful login attempts
echo "auth required pam_tally2.so deny=6 unlock_time=1200" | sudo tee -a /etc/pam.d/common-auth

# Reload the PAM configuration
sudo pam-auth-update
# Restart the service
sudo systemctl restart sshd
```


# üî≥ Kernel
1. Automatic update and upgrade of software.
2. GRUB password protection.
3. Secure Bootloader/GRUB directory


```sh
# 1. Generate a hashed password (MY_NEW_HASH) and capture it for user to be authorized (MY_SUDO_USER)
sudo grub-mkpasswd-pbkdf2
# 2. Open the GRUB configuration file for editing
sudo nano /etc/grub.d/40_custom 
# 3. Edit values (replace 'MY_SUDO_USER' and 'MY_SUDO_HASH' with your values)
echo 'set superusers="MY_SUDO_USER"' | sudo tee -a /etc/grub.d/40_custom
echo 'password_pbkdf2 MY_SUDO_USER MY_SUDO_HASH' | sudo tee -a /etc/grub.d/40_custom
# 4. Update GRUB
sudo update-grub


# Set the owner of the /boot directory to the root user and root group.
sudo chown root:root /boot
# Restrict permissions on the /boot directory to only allow the root user full access (read, write, and execute).
sudo chmod 700 /boot
```


# üóÉÔ∏è File System
1. Implement proper file system permissions.
   - change owner of directories to root
   - change permissions (the least privilege)
3. Utilize file system encryption for sensitive data.

```sh
# Set the owner of the /boot directory to the root user and root group.
sudo chown root:root /root
# Restrict permissions on the /boot directory to only allow the root user full access (read, write, and execute).
sudo chmod 700 /root

# Restrict access to system binaries
sudo chown root:root /bin
sudo chmod 711 /bin
sudo chown root:root /sbin
sudo chmod 711 /sbin
sudo chown root:root /usr/bin
sudo chmod 755 /usr/bin

# üìõ Firewall & Security


### Iptables

Iptables is a user-space utility that allows a system administrator to configure the IP packet filter rules of the Linux kernel firewall, implemented by different Netfilter modules. It offers a flexible and powerful interface for managing network traffic rules, enabling the creation of sophisticated firewall policies.

1. Use secure network protocols and disable insecure ones.
1. Block protocols
- ICMP, 
```sh
# - ICMP (Internet Control Message Protocol) - Drop all incoming packets from all IP's.
sudo iptables -A INPUT -p icmp -j DROP
```
2. Block traffic on specific ports
- 22, 443, 53, implicit deny
- Optional: 80
```sh
# Flush existing rules
sudo iptables -F

# Allow specific ports: SSH, DNS, HTTPS
sudo iptables -A INPUT -p tcp --dport 22 -j ACCEPT
sudo iptables -A INPUT -p tcp --dport 443 -j ACCEPT
sudo iptables -A INPUT -p udp --dport 53 -j ACCEPT

# Drop all other incoming traffic
sudo iptables -A INPUT -j DROP

# Allow specific ports for outgoing traffic: SSH, DNS, HTTPS
sudo iptables -A OUTPUT -p tcp --dport 22 -j ACCEPT
sudo iptables -A OUTPUT -p tcp --dport 443 -j ACCEPT
sudo iptables -A OUTPUT -p udp --dport 53 -j ACCEPT

### Firewall evasion block
# Drop invalid packets
sudo iptables -A INPUT -m conntrack --ctstate INVALID -j DROP
# Fragmented packets
sudo iptables -A INPUT -f -j DROP
# XMAS packets (all flags set)
sudo iptables -A INPUT -p tcp --tcp-flags ALL ALL -j DROP
# Null packets (no flags set)
sudo iptables -A INPUT -p tcp --tcp-flags ALL NONE -j DROP
# SYN-FIN combination packets
sudo iptables -A INPUT -p tcp --tcp-flags SYN,FIN SYN,FIN -j DROP
# SYN-RST combination packets
sudo iptables -A INPUT -p tcp --tcp-flags SYN,RST SYN,RST -j DROP
# FIN-PSH-URG combination packets
sudo iptables -A INPUT -p tcp --tcp-flags FIN,PSH,URG FIN,PSH,URG -j DROP

# Drop all traffic on specific ports associated with malware
sudo iptables -A INPUT -p all --match multiport --sports 23432,31338,31337,31339,18006,139,12349,44444,6667,8012,80,7597,21,4000,3150,666,2140,1026,10048,64666,23,22222,6969,11000,7626,113,10100,1001,21544,3131,7777,1243,6267,25,6776,25685,27374,68,6400,1120,12345,7300,1234 -j DROP

# Drop malicious IP's
# https://www.projecthoneypot.org/
# https://snort-org-site.s3.amazonaws.com/production/document_files/files/000/027/943/original/ip_filter.blf?X-Amz-Algorithm=AWS4-HMAC-SHA256&X-Amz-Credential=AKIAU7AK5ITMJQBJPARJ%2F20231225%2Fus-east-1%2Fs3%2Faws4_request&X-Amz-Date=20231225T212013Z&X-Amz-Expires=3600&X-Amz-SignedHeaders=host&X-Amz-Signature=a38647e23b9d760e8bdef781c99d6c78760b2856b9ada38ff76d619807046045

# Drop all other outgoing traffic
sudo iptables -A OUTPUT -j DROP
```

### Fail2Ban

Fail2Ban scans log files like /var/log/auth.log and bans IP addresses conducting too many failed login attempts. It does this by updating system firewall rules to reject new connections from those IP addresses, for a configurable amount of time.

- Install requirements & software
- Configure service
- Adjust logging and "ban" rate requirements


```sh
### Install requirements
# Install Python (version 3.5 or later)
sudo apt install python3 -y
# Install pip (Python package installer)
sudo apt install python3-pip -y
# Install setuptools and distutils
sudo apt install python3-setuptools python3-distutils -y
# Install PyPy3
sudo apt install pypy3 -y

### Install fail2ban
# Install fail2ban
apt-get install fail2ban
#

here
```

How to use fail2ban
Main syntax:
```sh
fail2ban-client -h
```

### ‚úîÔ∏è Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure that you have the following prerequisites installed:

>  ` Linux`


### üéÆ Using SLH

1. Run terminal on choosen machine.
2. Update your system - optionally upgrade distribution
3. Choose section of hardening scripts and execute them with elevated privileges.

### Legend of objects in scripts
1. Accounts and system
```sh
Root (MY_SUDO_USER):
    root:root
Regular user:
    danny:password
Remote user using SSH (MY_REMOTE_USER)
    danny:danny
System IP
    (MY_IP)
```
```sh
2. Values to change by user
Hash value for sudo user password:
    MY_SUDO_HASH
Public key:
    MY_PUBLIC_KEY
Private key:
    MY_PRIVATE_KEY
```


---


### ‚ö†Ô∏è Warning

While developing SLH (Secure Linux Hardening) scripts, I encountered instances where improper modifications led to system failures or **full bricking**. Deploying these scripts in a production environment without thorough testing can result in irreversible damage to critical system functions. Working on **snapshots** is highly recommended in this manner.

Key Points:

1. Testing is Crucial: Prioritize testing SLH scripts in a dedicated environment to avoid unpredictable consequences.
2. Production Caution: Refrain from deploying scripts directly in production without rigorous testing due to the potential for unforeseen issues.
3. Understand the scripts: Exercise caution, understand the impact of changes, and follow best practices for system configuration and security.
4. Documentation and Backup: Document changes, maintain backups, and monitor system modifications for security and reliability.
5. Stay Informed: Keep updated on script improvements, security practices, and Linux administration for a secure environment.
6. Adopt Gradually: If deploying in production, adopt changes gradually, monitoring closely for unexpected issues.
7. Customization Matters: Customize scripts based on specific environment needs to balance security and functionality.

**Use SLH wisely to enhance security while minimizing risks.**
