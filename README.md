# üõ†Ô∏è SYSTEM MAINTENANCE
1. Update distribution
2. Update system and services
3. Remove unnecessary libraries
4. Set automatic updates every one week

```sh
# Update distribution (might cause problem with used apt process)
sudo apt dist-upgrade
# Update system and services
sudo apt update & sudo apt upgrade
# Removal of unnecessary libraries
sudo apt-get autoremove & sudo apt-get autoremove --purge
```


# üë®‚Äçüíº ACCOUNTS
1. Password policies
- Password age
- Password complexity requirements
- Implement multi-factor authentication where possible.


### Main syntax
```sh
# Set the maximum password age to 30 days
sudo echo "password [success=1 default=ignore]       pam_unix.so maxage=30" >> /etc/pam.d/sshd
# Add password complexity requirements
sudo echo "password [success=1 default=ignore]       pam_unix.so minlen=12 minclasstype=4 minlenclasses=4" >> /etc/pam.d/sshd
# Reload the PAM configuration
sudo pam-auth-update
# Restart the service
sudo systemctl restart sshd
```


# üî≥ KERNEL


# üóÉÔ∏è FILE SYSTEM
1. Implement proper file system permissions.
2. Utilize file system encryption for sensitive data.


# üßæ LOGGING AND AUDITING
1. Implement centralized logging for better analysis.


# üìõ NETWORK, SERVICES, FIREWALL
1. Configure and maintain firewall rules using tools like iptables.
### Default syntax
```sh
1. Disable and/or uninstall unnecessary network services.
- Check status of service
systemctl status <service_name>
systemctl show --property=ActiveState --property=SubState <service_name>
- Get info about package
systemctl list-unit-files | grep <package_name>
- Stop, disable, uninstall service, remove its package.
sudo systemctl stop <service_name> && sudo apt remove --purge --auto-remove -y <package_name>
```
